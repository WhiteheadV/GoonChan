        newHash: "Possible new hash for the user"},
    status:"status of the operation",
    data: "Any kind of data to be returned will be in this field"
}

The authstatus can be either 'ok' or 'expired', in which case the user hash must be replaced by the content of 'newHash'.

    bypassable: use has been prevented from posting but its possible for him to use the block bypass to post.
